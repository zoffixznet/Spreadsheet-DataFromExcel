Spreadsheet-DataFromExcel

For some lucky reason I often and up given data to work with in Excel 
format. Nothing fancy, just one sheet with basic string data.

My steps to utilize it in a perl program were either copy/pasting it
into a text file and splitting on \t or firing up 
L<Spreadsheet::ParseExcel> and trying to figure out what exactly that I
needed was. No more! Welcome the L<Spreadsheet::DataFromExcel>!

L<Spreadsheet::DataFromExcel> to L<Spreadsheet::ParseExcel> is
what a bycicle is to a freight truck. L<Spreadsheet::DataFromExcel>
offers a "no crust" loading of Excel sheets into an arrayref of arrayrefs
where each inner arrayref represents a row and its elements represent 
cells.

If you're looking for any more control or data,
see L<Spreadsheet::ParseExcel> or L<Spreadsheet::Read>
